SQLAlchemy — Python Tutorial
===============================================================================

## Disclaimer

For it to work reasonably well, I had to add primary keys to the tables where
there weren't any in the tutorial.

## Comments

I found this tutorial unrefined, lacking and full of errors. It was also
extremely difficult to follow along since none of the data used to perform the
queries were provided. I would NOT recommend this tutorial.
