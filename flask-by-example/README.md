Flask by Example
===============================================================================

## Disclaimer

I'm allowing myself to deviate from the tutorial in some areas:
- Using a later Python version
- Naming my virtual environment differently
- Using a later version of Flask
- Using single quotes (') instead of double quotes in many places (")
- Using some of the later versions of other dependencies
